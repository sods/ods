    details: >
      The 'average' column contains the monthly mean CO2 mole fraction
      determined from daily averages.  The mole fraction of CO2, expressed as
      parts per million (ppm) is the number of molecules of CO2 in every one
      million molecules of dried air (water vapor removed).  If there are
      missing days concentrated either early or late in the month, the monthly
      mean is corrected to the middle of the month using the average seasonal
      cycle.  Missing months are denoted by -99.99. The 'interpolated' column
      includes average values from the preceding column and interpolated values
      where data are missing.  Interpolated values are computed in two steps. 
      First, we compute for each month the average seasonal cycle in a 7-year
      window around each monthly value.  In this way the seasonal cycle is
      allowed to change slowly over time.  We then determine the 'trend' value
      for each month by removing the seasonal cycle; this result is shown in the
      'trend' column.  Trend values are linearly interpolated for missing
      months. The interpolated monthly mean is then the sum of the average
      seasonal cycle value and the trend value for the missing month.


      NOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to
      change, depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and
      other quality control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be
      changed for the same reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.

        These data are made freely available to the public and the scientific community in the belief that their wide dissemination will lead to greater understanding and new scientific insights. The availability of these data does not constitute publication of the data.  NOAA relies on the ethics and integrity of the user to insure that ESRL receives fair credit for their work.  If the data  are obtained for potential use in a publication or presentation,  ESRL should be informed at the outset of the nature of this work.   If the ESRL data are essential to the work, or if an important  result or conclusion depends on the ESRL data, co-authorship may be appropriate.  This should be discussed at an early stage in the work.  Manuscripts using the ESRL data should be sent to ESRL for review before they are submitted for publication so we can insure that the quality and limitations of the data are accurately represented.

        RECIPROCITY  Use of these data implies an agreement to reciprocate. Laboratories making similar measurements agree to make their own data available to the general public and to the scientific community in an equally complete and easily accessible form. Modelers are encouraged to make available to the community, upon request, their own tools used in the interpretation of the ESRL data, namely well documented model code, transport fields, and additional information necessary for other scientists to repeat the work and to run modified versions. Model availability includes collaborative support for new users of the models.

      MovieLens data sets were collected by the GroupLens Research Project at
      the University of Minnesota.


      This data set consists of:
        * 100,000 ratings (1-5) from 943 users on 1682 movies.
        * Each user has rated at least 20 movies. 
        * Simple demographic info for the users (age, gender, occupation, zip)

      The data was collected through the MovieLens web site (movielens.umn.edu)
      during the seven-month period from September 19th, 1997 through April
      22nd, 1998. This data has been cleaned up - users who had less than 20
      ratings or did not have complete demographic information were removed from
      this data set.

      coverage in 2014, to build Nigeria’s first nation-wide inventory of health
      facility. The database includes 34,139 health facilities info in Nigeria.


      The goal of this database is to make the data collected available to
      planners, government officials, and the public, to be used to make
      strategic decisions for planning relevant interventions.

      The dataset represents the Common Operational Data (COD) for
      administrative boundaries of Nigeria. Each administrative unit contains
      the p-code and name. Admin COD datasets (Admin 0 – 2) for Nigeria are
      endorsed by the Office of the Surveyor General of the Federal Republic of
      Nigeria (OSGOF) and the IMWG Feb 2017. See metadata for description of
      methodology for admin level 3 and the cleaning and processing performed by
      ITOS. Levels 0 - 3 are polygonal administrative units, Level 3 only covers
      Adamawa, Borno and Yobe States and are for operational purposes only.

       A senatorial district shapefile is also included. Senatorial districts respect administrative level 1 (state) but are not reflected in the gazetteer, geodatabase, or live services.

       Vetting and live service provision by [Information Technology Outreach Services (ITOS)](https://cviog.uga.edu/international-center/) with funding from USAID.

       The administrative level 0-2 and senatorial district boundaries are suitable for database or GIS linkage to the [Nigeria 2016 Population Data tables](https://data.humdata.org/dataset/nigeria-2016-population-data).

       A topojson generalized version of administrative level 3 is also provided.

      The purpose of this repository is to collate data on the ongoing
      coronavirus pandemic in Africa. Our goal is to record detailed information
      on each reported case in every African country. We want to build a line
      list – a table summarizing information about people who are infected,
      dead, or recovered. The table for each African country would include
      demographic, location, and symptom (where available) information for each
      reported case. The data will be obtained from official sources (e.g., WHO,
      departments of health, CDC etc.) and unofficial sources (e.g., news). Such
      a dataset has many uses, including studying the spread of COVID-19 across
      Africa and assessing similarities and differences to what’s being observed
      in other regions of the world.

      qPCR TaqMan array single cell experiment in mouse. The data is taken from
      the early stages of development when the Blastocyst is forming. At the 32
      cell stage the data is already separated into the trophectoderm (TE) which
      goes onto form the placenta and the inner cellular mass (ICM). The ICM
      further differentiates into the epiblast (EPI)---which gives rise to the
      endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm---and the primitive endoderm (PE) which
      develops into the amniotic sack. Guo et al selected 48 genes for
      expression measurement. They labelled the resulting cells and their labels
      are included as an aide to visualization. Normalization was done as
      described in the publication's methods section.
    normalization: >-
      "All Ct values (Tables S4 and S5) obtained from the BioMark System were
      con- verted into relative expression levels by subtracting the values from
      the assumed baseline value of 28. Cells with low or absent endogenous
      control gene expression levels were removed from analysis ( 10%). The
      resulting values were at times normalized to the endogenous control by
      subtracting, for each cell, the average of its Actb and Gapdh expression
      levels. As the Ct scale is logarithmic (a difference of one Ct corresponds
      to a doubling of measured transcript), a subtraction of the average of two
      genes on this scale corresponds to taking the geometric mean on a linear
      scale. Data shown in Figures 1A–1C, 2A, 3A, 3B, 4A, 5A, and 5D have been
      normalized against endogenous controls". We additionally standardize the
      data gene-by-gene N(0, 1) for each gene across cells.

      The Kepler spacecraft was launched into an earth trailing orbit and stared
      at a 100 sq. degree patch of sky near Cygnus in order to measure the
      brightness variations of about 200,000 stars.  It's primary mission was to
      find exoplanets transiting these stars and to determine the prevalence of
      exoplanets in the Galaxy.  The Kepler spacecraft rotated by 90 degrees
      every 90 days in order to keep the solar panels pointing at the sun and
      thus the Kepler data is divided into 90-day quarters. Kepler only
      downloaded the pixels surrounding selected stars of interest at either a
      30-minute or 1-minute cadence. The mission produced a flux time series for
      each star and searched these light curves for the presence of a transiting
      exoplanet.  In addition to discovering exoplanets, Kepler data has been
      used to study the variability of stars and eclipsing binaries.
