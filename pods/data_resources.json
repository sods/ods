It's primary mission was to find exoplanets transiting these stars and to determine the prevalence of exoplanets in the Galaxy.  The Kepler spacecraft rotated by 90 degrees every 90 days in order to keep the solar panels pointing at the sun and thus the Kepler data is divided into 90-day quarters. Kepler only downloaded the pixels surrounding selected stars of interest at either a 30-minute or 1-minute cadence. The mission produced a flux time series for each star and searched these light curves for the presence of a transiting exoplanet.  In addition to discovering exoplanets, Kepler data has been used to study the variability of stars and eclipsing binaries.",

        "details": "The 'average' column contains the monthly mean CO2 mole fraction determined from daily averages.  The mole fraction of CO2, expressed as parts per million (ppm) is the number of molecules of CO2 in every one million molecules of dried air (water vapor removed).  If there are missing days concentrated either early or late in the month, the monthly mean is corrected to the middle of the month using the average seasonal cycle.  Missing months are denoted by -99.99. The 'interpolated' column includes average values from the preceding column and interpolated values where data are missing.  Interpolated values are computed in two steps.  First, we compute for each month the average seasonal cycle in a 7-year window around each monthly value.  In this way the seasonal cycle is allowed to change slowly over time.  We then determine the 'trend' value for each month by removing the seasonal cycle; this result is shown in the 'trend' column.  Trend values are linearly interpolated for missing months. The interpolated monthly mean is then the sum of the average seasonal cycle value and the trend value for the missing month.\n\nNOTE: In general, the data presented for the last year are subject to change, depending on recalibration of the reference gas mixtures used, and other quality control procedures. Occasionally, earlier years may also be changed for the same reasons.  Usually these changes are minor.\n\nCO2 expressed as a mole fraction in dry air, micromol/mol, abbreviated as ppm \n\n (-99.99 missing data;  -1 no data for daily means in month)",

The database includes 34,139 health facilities info in Nigeria.\n\n The goal of this database is to make the data collected available to planners, government officials, and the public, to be used to make strategic decisions for planning relevant interventions.\n\n For data inquiry, please contact Ms. Funlola Osinupebi, Performance Monitoring & Communications, Advisory Power Team, Office of the Vice President at funlola.osinupebi@aptovp.org\n\n To learn more, please visit <http://csd.columbia.edu/2014/03/10/the-nigeria-mdg-information-system-nmis-takes-open-data-further/>",

At the 32 cell stage the data is already separated into the trophectoderm (TE) which goes onto form the placenta and the inner cellular mass (ICM). The ICM further differentiates into the epiblast (EPI)---which gives rise to the endoderm, mesoderm and ectoderm---and the primitive endoderm (PE) which develops into the amniotic sack. Guo et al selected 48 genes for expression measurement. They labelled the resulting cells and their labels are included as an aide to visualization. Normalization was done as described in the publication's methods section.",
        "normalization": "\"All Ct values (Tables S4 and S5) obtained from the BioMark System were con- verted into relative expression levels by subtracting the values from the assumed baseline value of 28. Cells with low or absent endogenous control gene expression levels were removed from analysis ( 10%). The resulting values were at times normalized to the endogenous control by subtracting, for each cell, the average of its Actb and Gapdh expression levels. As the Ct scale is logarithmic (a difference of one Ct corresponds to a doubling of measured transcript), a subtraction of the average of two genes on this scale corresponds to taking the geometric mean on a linear scale. Data shown in Figures 1A‚Äì1C, 2A, 3A, 3B, 4A, 5A, and 5D have been normalized against endogenous controls\". We additionally standardize the data gene-by-gene N(0, 1) for each gene across cells.",
